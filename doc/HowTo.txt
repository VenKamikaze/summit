How to get Summit running quickly:

Pre-requisites:

* Java7+
* Maven 3+
* Apache Tomcat or similar container software
* A database (note: so far only tested against Postgres, other databases YMMV)

1) Clone the repository, for now the 'master' branch will usually have the latest changes:
git clone https://github.com/VenKamikaze/summit.git
cd summit

2) Review and execute the SQL under src/main/resources/sql in this order. 
2a) dba_ddl.sql  (creates the user and tablespace - please modify to suit your environment).
2b) ddl.sql (creates the schema table structure used by summit)
2c) test_dml.sql (not strictly necessary, contains Demo/Test data to show the current capability of summit)

3) Modify src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/database.properties to contain your connection details as per (2a).

4) Build the project
mvn clean package

5) Deploy your built summit.war to your Java web application container software:
sudo cp target/summit.war /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/  (if your tomcat env is similar to mine and setup to auto-deploy, this would explode the WAR automatically).

6) Access http://localhost:8080/summit/run/1/2 or appropriate location for your container software to run a summit page(if you ran (2c) this should show a report page).
