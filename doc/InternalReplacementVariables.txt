The following replacment variables are processed by the internal formatters and replaced with identifiers unique to each section:

##__DATA__## : This identifies sub-region or data driven replacement locations.
##__REGION-ID__## : This identifies an ID for the current region. This value does not exist if you are not within a region.
##__PAGE-ID__## : This identifies an ID for the current page.
##__ID__## : This identifies an ID for the current item being processed. May not be unique between item types, e.g. will be unique per field on a page, but a field id may be shared with e.g. a region.
