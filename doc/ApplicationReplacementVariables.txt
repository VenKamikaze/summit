The following replacment variables are processed by the generic formatter and replaced with identifiers that can be specified via the src/main/resources/applicationContext-replacement-vars.xml file:

##__CONTEXTPATH__## : /summit
##__APIPATH__## : /summit/api

You can modify the above to suit your environment, for example if you have summit behind a proxy you may need to modify the generated path for CONTEXTPATH or APIPATH. You can also add your own and then use them within your templates.
