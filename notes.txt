* Render:

* Picks up wanted page by ${applicationId}/${pageId}
* Controller hands off to PageService
* PageService pulls in:
** Page Domain, linked domain objects such as Regions, RegionField, Fields.
** Linked templates

* First pass in rendering then grabs the template and puts it into an object that is manipulated.
* A pass is then done on the Fields, executing any SQL to bring in values.
* A pass is then done on Regions, inserting the post processed Fields into the Regions
* A pass is then done on the template, inserting regions into appropriate areas
* Full page is then returned to the client requesting it.


Passes should be done in the above order, to stop people inserting textual values that look like replacement region strings and them being replaced by the parser.
